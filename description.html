Redirects YouTube requests to an alternative frontend of your choice, defaults to <a href="https://github.com/omarroth/invidious">invidio.us</a>. The settings page allows you to configure
a specific Invidious instance to which the request will be redirected. Choose your instance <a href="https://github.com/omarroth/invidious/wiki/Invidious-Instances">here</a>. You can also
use a different instance for embeddable content and normal tabs.

This extension was derived from <a href="https://github.com/doronbehar/invidious-redirect">@doronbehar version</a>
but I've added a fix, so that the "Watch on Youtube" button actually opens Youtube instead of getting redirected back to invidious as well as enabling it
for Firefox on Android
