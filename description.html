Redirects YouTube requests to an alternative front-end of your choice, defaults to <a href="https://github.com/omarroth/invidious">invidio.us</a>. The settings page allows you to configure a specific Invidious instance to which the request will be redirected. Choose your instance <a href="https://github.com/omarroth/invidious/wiki/Invidious-Instances">here</a>. You can also use a different instance for embedded content and normal tabs.

This extension was derived from <a href="https://github.com/metiis/invidious-redirect">@metiis version</a> but it was refined in my fork according to a few ideas of mine and an <a href="https://github.com/metiis/invidious-redirect/issues/10">internal design improvement suggestion</a>.
